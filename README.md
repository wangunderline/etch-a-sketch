# etch-a-sketch

This Etch-a-Sketch game was made using loops in JavaScript and flexbox. DOM skills were required, in addition to some knowledge of flexbox properties.

The game starts with a 16x16 grid, which can be changed according to the value defined in the popup. The color of the squares is randomly defined when hovering over them. There is a button to clear the board, and the user can clear an individual board by clicking it as well.
